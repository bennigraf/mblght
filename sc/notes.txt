So far:


* summing-bus-object:
  Methods of summing: adding values & clipping them? Would work...
  Adding methods to bus like .add or .multiply??
  Or use special NodeProxys/Synths for that? Like 
	Adder(srcNodeProxy1, srcNodeProxy2) => creates NodeProxy with added output
  Flexible Routing!! Some (graphic?) notation? Or at least visual representation?



TODO:
* some messages to patcher to get:
  each bus of a certain method from any device or any nth device or whatever to iterate over in a synth
* some sort of summing-bus-object (see above), but prbly before patcher
