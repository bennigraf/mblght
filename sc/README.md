This is my try on using SuperCollider DSP magic (on scsynth) to synthesize signals which can control various lighting fixtures using the Open Lighting Architecture (OLA) to play out Artnet and/or DMX signals.

Some colorful pictures (it's about the lighting, not the projection, which was part of the Stereo Tam Tam gig):
